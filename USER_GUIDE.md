-   A standard list of construction items is created automatically when you create a new site.

### Vendors

**Vendors** are the suppliers you purchase materials and services from.

### Accounts

**Accounts** are used to track your finances. You can create multiple accounts to represent your cash, bank accounts, or digital wallets.
